# The Arena

A multiplayer game created using NodeJS, SocketIO, and Server-Side Javascript - created at DefHacks 2016.

The game was created for to introduce soft-core gamers to an easy-to-play, in browser multiplayer survival-type game.

Players can walk and sprint around, picking up food and water in order to survive. Players can carry up to 5 items in their item slots and use these items to defeat other players. Players can attack each other with their fists or with a weapon by clicking in the other player's direction. Different weapons have different attack speeds and do different amounts of damage!

Players can customize their skill set before they join the game to create more of a dynamic gaming experience (agility, strength, etc.)

Shadows are updated for each player so players on opposite sides of objects cannot see each other.

Created by Jonathan Mendelson, Aman Sanger, Jake Sanders, and Michael Caosun.
